Save your project and create a GitHub repo for it titled exercise7
Create an HTML document for this recipe using the best practices we learned at the beginning of the semester.
Download the above photo upload it to your project (my project >> uploadAssets() ) and then use the img tag to place it after 'Yield' and before 'Ingredients'
Within your body tag, use HTML tags to organize the recipe content:
create a central div with a width of 1200px that contains the entire recipe.
use at least three different type of headers (h1, h2, h3, etc.) for different headlines or titles in the recipe.
use the paragraph tag for each preparation instruction paragraph
use an unordered list to organize the ingredients.
Using what we learned in the CSS positioning lecture, demo, and exercise, create a 2-column design with the title/credits and Ingredients on the left and the photo and preparation instructions on the right. You will need to figure out the width and proportions of your columns.
Use Google Fonts to select at least two and a maximum of three fonts to typeset the recipe. Note: the second half of the lecture shows how to setup Google Fonts.
Now, typeset the page to be attractive:
Assign selected fonts to the body text, headers, and lists.
Set a base font size for html or body in pixels and use ems to set relative sizes for body text, headers, and lists.
Adjust line-height and letter-spacing for at least one of your selected fonts. 
Once your font hierarchy is established, take control of the space between different blocks of text using margin and padding.
Optional: play with text-transform for one or more of your fonts, or font-weight if you select a Google Font with multiple available weights.
Use colour or any other design element we've learned this semester to enhance your design. 
Most importantly, have fun and ensure your design reflects your aesthetic and stylistic preferences! Below is a reference image of a completed design, don't try to match it exactly, use colour, type, and spacing to put your own spin on it.

Spinach, Tofu and Sesame Stir-Fry
By: Martha Rose Shulman
Yield: 3 Servings

Ingredients

1 tablespoon canola oil
½ pound tofu, cut in small dice
1 large garlic clove, minced
1 teaspoon grated or minced fresh ginger
¼ teaspoon red chili flakes
Soy sauce to taste
16-ounce bag baby spinach, rinsed
2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds
1 teaspoon sesame oil

Preparation

Step 1
Heat the canola oil over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet or wok, and add the tofu. Stir-fry until the tofu is lightly colored, three to five minutes, and add the garlic, ginger and chili flakes. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about one minute, and add soy sauce to taste. Add the spinach and stir-fry until the spinach wilts, about one minute. Stir in the sesame seeds, and add more soy sauce to taste. Remove from the heat.

Step 2
Using tongs, transfer the spinach and tofu mixture to a serving bowl, leaving the liquid behind in the pan or wok. Drizzle with the sesame oil, and add more soy sauce as desired. Serve with rice or other grains, or noodles. You may also use it as a filling for whole wheat pita bread.

Tip
Advance preparation: This is a last-minute preparation, but you can have your ingredients prepared well in advance.
